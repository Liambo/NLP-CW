Project completed for Natural Language Processing module as part of M.Sci in Computer Science and Mathematics at Durham University.
System is programmed in Pytorch and Scikit-Learn and compares effectiveness of basic linear regression models vs. deep-learning based GRU models for article classification. System uses both TF-IDF and BERT embeddings to encode articles and healines separately.
Train and test datasets are taken from the 2017 Fake News Challenge http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/
